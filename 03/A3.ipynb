    "In this assignment you will a train an LSTM to generate text. To be able to feed text into (recurrent) neural networks we first have to choose a good representation. There are several options to do so ranging from simple character embeddings to more sophisticated approaches like [word embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa) or [token embeddings](https://medium.com/@_init_/why-bert-has-3-embedding-layers-and-their-implementation-details-9c261108e28a). We will use a character embedding in this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Character embeddings work as follows. First we define an alphabet, a set of characters that we want to be able to represent. To feed a character into our network we use a one-hot vector. The dimension of this vector is equal to the size of our alphabet and the \"hot\" position indicates the character we want to represent. While this is logically a decent representation (all characters have the same norm, are orthogonal to one another, etc.) it is inefficient in terms of memory because we have to store a lot of zeros. In the first layer of our network we will multiply our one-hot vector with a weight matrix, i.e. we compute the preactivation by a matrix-vector product of the form $We_i$, where $e_i$ is the $i$-th canonical basis vector. This operation corresponds to selecting the $i$-th column of $W$. So an efficient implementation is to perform a simple lookup operation in $W$. This is how embedding layers work also for word or token embeddings. They are learnable lookup tables. \n",

    "## Exercise 1: Encoding characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class `Encoder` that implements the methods `__init__` and `__call__`. The method `__init__` takes a string as argument that serves as alphabet. The method `__call__` takes one argument. If it is a string then it should return a sequence of integers as `torch.Tensor` of shape  representing the input string. Each integer should represents a character of the alphabet. The alphabet consists of the characters matched by the regex `[a-z0-9 .!?]`. If the input text contains characters that are not in the alphabet, then `__call__` should either remove them or map them to a corresponding character that belongs to the alphabet. If the argument is a `torch.Tensor`, then the method should return a string representation of the input, i.e. it should function as decoder. "

    "Write a class `TextDataset` that derives from `torch.utlis.data.Dataset`. It should wrap a text file and utilize it for training with pytorch. Implement the methods `__init__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`. The method `__init__` should take a path to a text file as string and an integer `l` specifying the length of one sample sequence. The method `__len__` takes no arguments and should return the size of the dataset, i.e. the number of sample sequences in the dataset. The method `__getitem__` should take an integer indexing a sample sequence and should return that sequence as a `torch.Tensor`. The input file can be viewed as one long sequence. The first sample sequence consists of the characters at positions `0..l-1` in the input file. The second sequence consists of the characters at positions `l..2*l-1` and so on. That is, the samples of our dataset are non-overlapping sequences. The last incomplete sequence may be dropped. "

If the optimizer is `None`, then the function should validate the model. Otherwise it should train the model for next-character prediction in the many-to-many setting. That is, given a sequence `x` of length `l`, the input sequence is `x[:l-1]` and the corresponding target sequence is `x[1:]`. The function should perform one epoch of training/validation and return the loss values of each mini batch as a numpy array. Use the cross-entropy loss function for both training and validation. "

In fact, `freqs` may contain any real numbers. \n",
