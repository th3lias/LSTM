    "## Exercise 1: Causal Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class named `CausalSelfAttention` that derives from `nn.Module` and whose `__init__` method takes (apart from the trivial `self`) one argument `hidden_size`. Implement a method `forward` that takes an input sequence `x` of shape $(N, T, D)$ (where $N$ is batch size, $T$ is sequence length, $D$ is hidden size) and performs scaled dot-product self-attention, i.e., \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}} Q K^\\top\\right) V,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Q = X W_Q$ and $K = X W_K$ and $V = X W_V$ and $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D}$ and $W_Q, W_K, W_V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times D}$ and softmax is applied in a row-wise manner and neglecting bias units. \n",
    "It is called self-attention because $Q, K, V$ are all computed from the same input $X$, which hence attends to itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "To have the attention be *causal* we need to make sure that we do not allow peeks into the future. That is, the output at time $t$ must be a function of the input at times $1, \\dots, t$ but no further. The score matrix $E = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}} Q K^\\top$ has a shape of $T \\times T$ and the entry $e_{ij}$ measures how strong the query at time $i$ attends to the key at time $j$. Therefore, positions where $j > i$ constitute peeks into the future and we have to set the corresponding attention values (i.e., the softmax-activated score) to zero. We can do that by setting the corresponding score to `float('-inf')`, which has the advantage that the normalization is adjusted automatically by the softmax. "
